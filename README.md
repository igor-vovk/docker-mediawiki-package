# Tiny MediaWiki Docker Container

https://www.mediawiki.org/

This container is based on [Canasta](https://github.com/CanastaWiki/Canasta) package and takes some stuff from it.

Few problems that didn't allow me to use it:
* SQLite support
* this container uses latest version of MediaWiki at the moment, 1.39.0
